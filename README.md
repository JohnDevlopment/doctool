# Doctool

Doctool is a Perl-based program I've written for the sole purpose of generating doc files for my custom classes, written in GDScript.

As of right now, the following goals are met:

- [X] Create "header" section with the class name and description
- [X] Create "properties" section with a list of exported properties
- [ ] Create "methods" section with a list of exposed methods
- [ ] Create "signals" section with a list of defined signals
